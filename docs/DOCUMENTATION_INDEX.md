## For Developers

### New Contributors
1. Start with **[README.md](../README.md)** for project overview
2. Read **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** for setup and contribution guidelines
3. Review **[TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** for system understanding
4. Use **[API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)** for integration details

### Current Development Focus: M0.5
- **Goal**: Visual proof of concept with Bevy 3D terrain displacement
- **Status**: Ready to begin - all technical risks eliminated
- **Next Steps**: Implement Bevy scene with fear-responsive terrain

### API Integration
- **[API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)** - Complete API documentation
- Focus on `FearSensor` trait and `FearScore` types
- Use `MockFearSensor` for development without hardware
- Cross-platform compatibility built-in

### Architecture Understanding
- **[TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Deep technical dive
- **[PROJECT_APPROACH.md](PROJECT_APPROACH.md)** - Design philosophy and strategy
- **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Production deployment

## Project Status

### âœ… Completed Achievements
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, and Linux deployment ready
- **Real Camera Integration**: OpenCV-based camera enumeration and capture
- **YuNet CNN Integration**: Modern face detection with embedded models
- **ONNX Runtime 2.0**: High-performance emotion recognition
- **Adaptive Calibration**: Personalized fear measurement system
- **Production Architecture**: Async, thread-safe, embedded models

### ðŸš§ Current Development: M0.5
- **Goal**: Visual proof of concept with Bevy 3D terrain
- **Target**: Fear-responsive terrain displacement at 60 FPS
- **Status**: Technical foundation complete, ready for visual development

## Quick Start Commands

### Verify System
```bash
# Test camera and fear detection
cargo run --bin spectreprobe

# Test with mock data (no camera required)
cargo run --bin spectreprobe --mock

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Build for production
cargo build --release
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development with mock sensor
let mut sensor = MockFearSensor::step_pattern();
sensor.initialize(&config).await?;
let receiver = sensor.start().await?;

# Process fear scores in game loop
while let Ok(fear_score) = receiver.recv().await {
    update_terrain(fear_score.value);
}
```

## Documentation Maintenance
