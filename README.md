## Fear Detection Technology

### Technical Overview

SpectreMesh uses **emotion classification** rather than direct fear detection. Our system employs a 7-class emotion recognition model that classifies facial expressions into: **angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral**. We specifically extract the **fear logit** (probability) from this classification and normalize it relative to the individual's baseline emotional state.

**Key Insight**: Instead of trying to detect "fear" directly, we measure how much the fear emotion probability deviates from the person's normal emotional baseline, creating a personalized fear intensity score.

### Model Architecture

**FaceONNX Emotion Recognition Model**
- **Input**: 48×48 grayscale face images
- **Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network optimized for facial emotion classification
- **Output**: 7-dimensional probability vector `[angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral]`
- **Fear Extraction**: We use `emotion_logits[2]` (fear probability) as our raw fear signal
- **Model Size**: ~5MB ONNX format with CPU/GPU compatibility

### Processing Pipeline

Our real-time emotion processing follows this validated pipeline:

```
1. Camera Capture (OpenCV)
   ├── V4L2/GStreamer backend (Linux)
   ├── AVFoundation backend (macOS)
   └── DirectShow backend (Windows)

2. Face Detection (YuNet CNN)
   ├── Modern multi-scale CNN face detection
   ├── Extract largest face region with confidence scoring
   └── Handle no-face scenarios gracefully

3. Image Preprocessing
   ├── Crop to face bounding box
   ├── Resize to 48×48 pixels
   ├── Convert BGR → RGB → Grayscale
   └── Normalize pixel values to [0.0, 1.0]

4. ONNX Runtime Inference
   ├── Load preprocessed image into tensor
   ├── Run emotion classification model
   ├── Extract 7-class emotion probabilities
   └── Target: <10ms inference time

5. Fear Logit Extraction
   ├── Extract fear probability: emotion_logits[2]
   ├── Raw fear logit range: typically [0.0, 1.0]
   └── Feed to calibration system

6. Calibration & Normalization
   ├── Collect baseline during 30-second calibration
   ├── Calculate personalized mean and variance
   ├── Apply Z-score normalization
   └── Output normalized fear score [0.0, 1.0]
```

### Calibration System

**Why Calibration is Essential**
- **Individual Differences**: People have different baseline emotional expressions
- **Environmental Factors**: Lighting, camera angle, and facial structure affect raw logits
- **Temporal Stability**: Ensures consistent fear measurement across sessions

**Calibration Process**
```rust
// 30-second calibration period
for sample in calibration_samples {
    let fear_logit = extract_fear_logit(emotion_logits);
    calibrator.add_sample(fear_logit);
}

// Exponential moving average calculation
mean = α * new_sample + (1 - α) * mean
variance = α * (new_sample - mean)² + (1 - α) * variance

// Z-score normalization
normalized_fear = (raw_fear_logit - baseline_mean) / sqrt(baseline_variance)
clamped_fear = clamp(normalized_fear, 0.0, 1.0)
```

**Calibration Mathematics**
- **Exponential Moving Average**: Adapts to changing conditions while maintaining stability
- **Z-Score Normalization**: `(x - μ) / σ` converts raw logits to standard deviations from baseline
- **Clamping**: Ensures output stays in usable [0.0, 1.0] range for terrain modification
- **Sample Rate**: 30 FPS during calibration for robust baseline establishment

### Technical Accuracy & Limitations

**What We Actually Measure**
- ✅ **Fear emotion probability** from facial expression classification
- ✅ **Deviation from personal baseline** emotional state
- ✅ **Relative fear intensity** normalized to individual characteristics
- ❌ **NOT direct physiological fear** (heart rate, skin conductance, etc.)
- ❌ **NOT absolute fear measurement** (highly individual and contextual)

**System Characteristics**
- **Accuracy**: Dependent on lighting conditions and face visibility
- **Latency**: 33ms total pipeline (30 FPS target)
- **Robustness**: Graceful degradation when face not detected
- **Privacy**: All processing local, no data transmitted

### Performance Characteristics

**Measured Performance (Real Hardware)**
```
Processing Pipeline:
├── Camera Capture: ~1ms (hardware dependent)
├── Face Detection: ~8-15ms (YuNet CNN multi-scale)
├── Preprocessing: ~1-2ms (resize, normalize)
├── ONNX Inference: ~3-8ms (target <10ms)
├── Calibration: ~0.1ms (mathematical operations)
└── Total Latency: ~13-26ms per frame

Throughput:
├── Target: 30 FPS (33ms per frame)
├── Achieved: 25-30 FPS (real hardware)
└── Calibration: 30 seconds for baseline

Resource Usage:
├── Memory: ~100MB (ONNX Runtime 2.0 + embedded models)
├── CPU: 15-25% single core (during processing)
├── GPU: Optional acceleration (CUDA/TensorRT)
└── Model Size: ~350KB (embedded YuNet + emotion model)
```

**Platform Performance**
- **Linux**: ✅ Validated on Ubuntu 20.04+ with V4L2 cameras
- **macOS**: ✅ Supported with AVFoundation camera backend
- **Windows**: ✅ Supported with DirectShow camera backend
- **Hardware**: Optimized for GTX 1050/M1 baseline, scales to higher-end GPUs

### Error Handling & Robustness

**Graceful Degradation**
- **No Face Detected**: Uses neutral emotion baseline (prevents terrain artifacts)
- **Camera Unavailable**: Falls back to mock sensor for development
- **Model Loading Failed**: Clear error messages with setup guidance
- **Inference Timeout**: Skips frame and continues processing
- **Calibration Incomplete**: Provides uncalibrated scores with clear indication

This technical foundation enables SpectreMesh to create responsive, personalized terrain modifications based on real-time emotional state analysis.

use spectre_sensor::compat::{FearSensor, MockFearSensor, YuNetFearSensor};

// For development (no hardware needed)
let mut sensor = MockFearSensor::step_pattern();
// For production (real YuNet CNN face detection)
// let mut sensor = YuNetFearSensor::new();

sensor.initialize(&config).await?;
let receiver = sensor.start().await?;

while let Ok(fear_score) = receiver.recv().await {
    // YOUR CODE: Use fear_score.value to modify terrain
    update_terrain(fear_score.value);
}
```

### Key APIs

- **`FearScore`**: Normalized fear level [0.0, 1.0] with metadata
- **`FearCalibrator`**: Z-score normalization with baseline establishment
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error taxonomy for all failure modes

3. Debug UI with manual fear slider
4. Integration with existing fear detection pipeline

**Success Criteria:**
- Bevy app displays 3D terrain that responds to fear input
- Smooth 60 FPS performance with real-time updates
- Clear visual correlation between fear level and terrain shape

### Getting Started with M0.5
1. Read `M0_TO_M0.5_HANDOFF.md` for detailed guidance
2. Study `API_REFERENCE_M0.md` for integration patterns
3. Review `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for milestone requirements
4. Start with mock fear sensor for visual development

### Development Guidelines
- **Don't modify `spectre_sensor/`** - it's complete and working with modern YuNet CNN
